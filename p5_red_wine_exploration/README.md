# P5. Red Wine Exploration
This repository contains my submission for Udacity's project Red Wine Exploration.

## Overview
***Data, by itself, is "ubiquitous and cheap," says Google's Chief Economist and UC Berkeley professor Hal Varian.***

In this project, we will conduct our own exploratory data analysis and create an RMD file that explores the variables, structure, patterns, oddities, and underlying relationships of a data set of our choice.

We will use a public dataset available which come from: P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos and J. Reis. Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties. In Decision Support Systems, Elsevier, 47(4):547-553. ISSN: 0167-9236.

***Our goal is to get a better understanding of which chemical properties influence the quality of red wines.***
