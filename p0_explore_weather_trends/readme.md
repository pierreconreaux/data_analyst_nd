# P0.Explore Weather Trends

This repository contains my submission for Udacity's project Explore Weather Trends.

## Instructions
My goal was to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where I live. To do this, I had follow the steps below:

- Extract the data from the database.
- Write a SQL query to extract the city level data.
- Write a SQL query to extract the global data.
- Open up the CSV
- Create a line chart that compares my cityâ€™s temperatures with the global temperatures.
- Make observations
