# P2. Investigate a dataset

For this Udacity's submission we have to choose a dataset and investigate it.

## Descriptions

The evaluation of the quality of a film leads to a multiplicity of opinions.

It is therefore not surprising that the quality of a commercially successful film is always debated.

Yet one could imagine that a film that is very successful must have the support of the majority of the audience.

However, it may be that the commercial achievement is only the consequence of a good trailer, good reviews or an excellent advertising campaign.

To propose an answer that is close to objectivity, we will use a database from The Movie Data base (TMDb).

TMDb's data includes 10,000 movies, as well as information on budgets, revenues, and the average rating of viewers.

Thus, we will be able to evaluate if the people have more appreciated the commercial successes or if the great financial performances are not a guarantee of quality.
