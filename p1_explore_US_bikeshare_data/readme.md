# P1. Explore US bikeshare data

This repository contains my submission for Udacity's project Explore US bikeshare data.

## Instructions

In this project, we will perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by Motivate, 
a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. 
We will compare the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. 
We will also see if there are any differences within each system for those users that are registered, 
regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users.

## Steps

- Data Collection
- Wrangling
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visualize Analysis
