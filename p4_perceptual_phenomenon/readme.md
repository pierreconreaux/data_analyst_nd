# P4. Perceptual Phenomenon

This repository contains my submission for Udacity's project perceptual phenomenon.

## Overview

In this project, we will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. 

We will learn a little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through 
the task. 

We will then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task 
and will compute some statistics describing the results. 

Finally, we will interpret our results in terms of hypotheses.
